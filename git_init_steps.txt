ohhh the difference b/w git add ./* and git add -A is the former only adds what is in the current dir

Steps for repo:
Make folder/make sure you are in correct one to push
git init to make it into a git repo
add/commit
get repo prepared on GitHub (dont add readme cause it forces you to do a pull first (makes ense since readme file is not on local) )
copy remote origin link
access token if not alreasdy
push
